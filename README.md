# Calculator_qml
A QML calculator is a calculator that is written in QML, a declarative language for creating user interfaces. QML calculators are typically used in Qt applications, but they can also be used in other frameworks that support QML.To create a QML calculator, you need to define the user interface using QML elements. You can then use JavaScript to define the logic for the calculator.
QML calculators can be made more complex by adding more buttons and features. You can also use JavaScript to add logic to the calculator, such as the ability to perform calculations.There are many resources available to help you learn how to create QML calculators. The Qt documentation has a good overview of QML, and there are many tutorials and examples available online.Here are some of the benefits of using QML to create calculators:QML is a declarative language, which makes it easy to create complex user interfaces.QML is lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for creating small, embedded applications.QML is supported by many frameworks, making it a versatile language for creating calculators.
